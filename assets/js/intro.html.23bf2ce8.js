I completed my high school studies at Miksa Déri Secondary school. Thanks to my curious nature, in order to know and understand new things, I study the given topic in depth. Toward to end of my studies, It turned out that I was most interested in science. Therefore I applied to the University of Szeged to study physics. Thanks to my persistence, I was able to participate in a project related to my graduate thesis. Near the end of my studies I realized that the software development has spread to almost every field. Finally I got the graduate degree in physics with laser physics specialization a few years ago. After graduation I immediately applied to a software developer higher diploma course.</p><p>• At the end of the course my supervisor offered me an assistant engineer position at University of Szeged.</p><p>• Later I applied to the metrologist position at Budapest Capiral Government Office. This role was focused on calibrating instruments for example brightness flux measurement, luminous flux measurement, spectral sensitivity measurement and refractometrics.</p><p>• As a microwave developer, then I worked at Dunakontroll Ltd, which is situated in Dunaújváros. My last role is focused on microwave engineering for example to search for new methods in the field of non-destructive material testing, improving the current calculation models</p><p>• Currently I am working at ELI-HU Non.profit Ltd as a physicist.</p><h2 id="publications" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#publications"><span>Publications</span></a></h2><div><a>[1]</a> L.
