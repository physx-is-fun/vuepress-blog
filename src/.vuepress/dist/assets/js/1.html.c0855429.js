Monstein and J.P. Wesley (Monstein & Wesley, 2002), when they claimed to have experimentally supported the existence of longitudinal electromagnetic waves. Around this time, the first alternative electrodynamics was born with the help of quaternions (van Vlaenderen & Waser, 2001). Later, following K. Rębilas (Rębilas, 2008), it turned out that the experimental results can be explained within the framework of classical electrodynamics. The principle of conservation of charge was supported by many experiments. The experiments were characterized by a long observation time, which means that the processes could have been averaged. The question may arise, if we repeat the measurements on the same system at sufficiently short intervals, will we experience fluctuations in the total amount of charge in a closed system? For some condensed matter systems, admitting discontinuities in the probability current is the cause of the violation of local conservation. This leads us to ask a logical theoretical question: how should one compute the electromagnetic field of a microscopic current that is not locally conserved? In such cases, the Aharonov-Bohm theory offers a logically consistent approach.",-1),o=(0,t.Lk)("p",null,"The laws of the theory of electrodynamics were formulated in quaternion form.
