According to the continuity equation, the change in photon yield N_photon leaving and entering a control volume with surface A and length l within the resonator through surface A is equal to the decrease of the control volume during time t. This expresses the conservation of the photon. The general form of the continuity equation contains a so-called sink or source, depending on the process being investigated.
