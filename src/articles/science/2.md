# Electron avalanche effect in spark discharges

<!-- more -->

## Abstract

The generation of the electric spark discharge is caused by the acceleration of the electrons due to the high electric field, creating more and more charge carriers through collisional ionization, thus forming the so-called electron avalanche. The simplest way to accelerate electrons is when we create a potential difference between 2 electrodes (weapons). In the first half of the discussion, I will present a proposed electrode geometry, thanks to which the peak effect can occur. Finally, I present a relatively simple model for the dynamics of the avalanche effect.
