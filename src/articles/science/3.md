# The continuity equation of the laser resonator

<!-- more -->

## Abstract

Optical systems, usually made of mirrors, in which light can travel back and forth through the same part of space several times, are called optical resonators (Almási, et al., 2013). According to the continuity equation, the change in photon yield N_photon leaving and entering a control volume with surface A and length l within the resonator through surface A is equal to the decrease of the control volume during time t. This expresses the conservation of the photon. The general form of the continuity equation contains a so-called sink or source, depending on the process being investigated. In the first half of the discussion, I define the possible source and sink in mathematical form. Finally, I derive the continuity equation for the laser resonator.
