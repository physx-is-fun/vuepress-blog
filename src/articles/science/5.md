## Abstract

A. Zhakatayev and L. Tlebaldiyeva in their article (Zhakatayev & Tlebaldiyeva, 2020) wrote about how an electric dipole can be used to generate, among other things, not only the transverse electromagnetic radiation spreading in the far zone, but also the longitudinal one at the same time. During the processing of the article, I think I discovered several fundamental errors. In this article, I will try to remedy these errors.
