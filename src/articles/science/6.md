# Recording and characterization of the characteristic curves of a Kia Ceed 1.6 CVVT engine

<!-- more -->

## Abstract

One of the most important operational characteristics of road vehicles powered by internal combustion engines is fuel consumption. It is characterized by the efficiency of energy conversion, with the help of which we can obtain information about the condition of the engine. Fuel consumption can be defined in several ways, which is influenced by countless factors. The following article presents a practical example of creating a brake-specific fuel consumption characteristic of an existing road vehicle.
